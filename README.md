# dojo-node
1.7rc4 up and running.. 

##Builder integrated
* not perfect but working in some way 



## REMOVED dono namespace
There has been a change in dojo-node from 1.6 to 1.7 
    

have a look at the test/test.js file to see the change in use.
Feel free to contact me if you have any problems upgrading.

    
    
### Future
* I will have a closer look to the new features introduced in 1.7
* The focus of the project depends on the feature requests and the development 
  of dojo in general. This project may split in one - following the original implementation 
  for the browser. The other one may provide plattform specific modules.
  

    
### Compatibility
* node.js 0.4 may work with older releases may not
